#Day 5: Loops

###Objective 
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

###Task 
Given an integer, _n_, print its first _10_ multiples. Each multiple _n x i_ (where _1 <= i <= 10_) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

###Input Format

A single integer, _n_.

###Constraints

-_2 <= n <= 20_

###Output Format

Print  lines of output; each line  (where ) contains the  of  in the form: 
n x i = result.

###Sample Input

-2

###Sample Output

-2 x 1 = 2
-2 x 2 = 4
-2 x 3 = 6
-2 x 4 = 8
-2 x 5 = 10
-2 x 6 = 12
-2 x 7 = 14
-2 x 8 = 16
-2 x 9 = 18
-2 x 10 = 20
